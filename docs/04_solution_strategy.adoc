== Solution Strategy

=== Technology decisions
We have made the following technology decisions:

  * *IDEs*:
  ** Some of us use _IntelliJ_ and others _Visual Studio Code_ to develop.
  * *Frameworks*:
   _React_ for the frontend and _Jest_ for testing.

  * *Version control*: _GitHub_. One branch per person.
  ** We will work with both *master* and *dev* branches and then each team member will have its own branch. From our point of view, this is the best way for organizing our code updates minimizing collisions as much as possible.

  * *Languages*: 
  ** _Javascript_: As we decided to work with Node.js and React.js, the language we will use is Javascript.
  ** _JSX_: Syntax extension to Javascript.
  ** _YAML_: Data serialization language that used for writing the GitHub workflow script.
  ** _Java_: For Gatling load testing.
  ** _Cucumber_: For E2E testing.
  

  * *External APIs*: _OpenStreetMap_ API. Mainly because it's completely free, not like Google Maps, which was our first option. However, itÂ´s a very used API too.

  * *Backend technology*: _Node.js_. Javascript runtime environment.
  ** We decided to work with Node because it is a well-known backend technology and also one of the best ways to implement SOLID Pods. The example project used it, so we were motivated to try it out.

  * *Frontend technology*: _React.js_. Frontend library.
  ** As mentioned above, the example written in React made us the choice easier. We do not have previous experience with frontend frameworks so its popularity and ease of learning was what made us to choose this technology.


=== Decisions about the top-level decomposition of the system

Our system will follow an MVC architecture. In this way, the visual part will clearly be separated from the database requests and then both of them will be coordinated by the controller part.

=== Decisions on how to achieve key quality goals

|===
|Quality goal
|How to achieve

|*Availability*
|Making sure that all the interactions the users make with our application are totally reliable and consistent. We will ensure that the system will do what it is supposed to.

|*Testability*
|Making most of the functions testable. This will let us create unit tests for these functions, and thus we will minimize the number of bugs.

|*Principle of data Minimisation*
| Ensuring that data are used only for their specific purpose, limiting the retention period and their accessibility to what is necessary.
With decentralization and by doing a strict control of permissions. This means users will only be able to access the data they are supposed to.

|*Accessibility/Usability*
|Making a user-friendly and easy to use interface. This means we will work on features like color contrast, keyboard accessibility, etc

=== Relevant organizational decisions
* *Communication*
** We use _Teams_ for our online meetings.
** We also have a _Discord_ team if we need it.
** We left the task distribution written with _GitHub Issues_.
** We have created a _Whatsapp_ group for short questions or messages.
** It is important to mention that even, although we use these channels, all decisions are always documented on the _GitHub Wiki_.

* *"No day before" policy*
** We have decided that all work will be done a couple of days before the deadline. This way, we avoid any potential last minute problems.

* *Language*
** The project will be done in English and the communication between the team members will be in Spanish (our mother tongue).
