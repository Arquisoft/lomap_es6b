|Solid API
|Because this is the first time we work with SOLID principles, we have no prior knowledge. This affects the project development process.

|React and JavaScript 
|Some of the team members do not know JavaScript. Also, none of them are familiar with the React library. This can cause difficulties at the beginning of the project that will disappear as time goes by.

|Medium
|Node.js
|None of the team has any knowledge of this platform, so there is an initial effort to learn how to use it.
