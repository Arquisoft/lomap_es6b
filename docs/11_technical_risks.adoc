|Risk
|Problem description
|Consideration
|Measures to be taken

|High
|Huge project
|We are under pressure to have the project completed to what is needed by the deadline.
|It is therefore necessary to have good communication and a good working dynamic among the members of the team.

|Medium
|Lack of knowledge about the technologies
|Most of the technologies used in the project are new to the team members. This requires extra effort at the beginning to learn them.
|Spend time learning and getting to know the new technologies.

|Medium
|Time availability 
|Due to the workload between different subjects and the problems of time compatibility. 
|It is necessary to have a good organisation and distribution of time between the members of the team. 

|Medium
|SOLID server availability
|The project is based on the SOLID platform and is therefore essential for its proper functioning. We are susceptible to bugs and changes within the technology.
Unfortunately we cannot control or alter Solidâ€™s development.
|We have no other option but to rely on SOLID, so we give the user different POD providers to choose from.

|Technical debts
|Considerations

|Slow data transfer
|The use of SOLID to store and share all the information we work with in the project. This results in longer waiting times than we would like.

|Some funcional features
|Due to lack of time we did not have time to implement some features we would like to. We had to prioritise the important functionality of the project.

|Some usability and features
|We wanted to implement the application in a way that it would be usable by all users and also that it would be adaptable and responsive to different devices, such as mobile, computer or tablet.
But due to lack of time, we did not complete it.
