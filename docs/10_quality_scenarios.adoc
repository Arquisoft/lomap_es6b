.Content
The quality tree (as defined in ATAM â€“ Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method) with quality/evaluation scenarios as leafs.

.Motivation
The tree structure with priorities provides an overview for a sometimes large number of quality requirements.

.Form
The quality tree is a high-level overview of the quality goals and requirements:

* tree-like refinement of the term "quality". Use "quality" or "usefulness" as a root
* a mind map with quality categories as main branches

In any case the tree should include links to the scenarios of the following section.

|===
| Quality attribute | Scenario | Approach
| Availability |  We want to offer a wide range of possibilities and submaps in which the user can search for all the information or location they want. | We want to develop the option so that the user can investigate by zooming in on the map and seeing submaps starting from a main map in order to see the locations as clearly as possible.
| Usability | Quick and easy navigation for not experienced users. | The main objective is to achieve a map and navigation within the application that is fast and indicative for users. That navigation operations such as scrolling on the map, zooming or the implementation of a search engine are easy to use and indicative for the end user.
| Decentralization | The isolated and centralized use of users' personal information and updating based on user preferences | ""
| Privacy | We do not want a fraudulent use of the user's personal information | Only the information of the user and/or friends will be shown if the user requests it, otherwise private information will never be shown.
| Accesibilty | 
We want the application to be usable for all the potential users that the final product may have. | Navigation and use of bright colors and aids to facilitate the use of the application
