| Quality attribute | Scenario | Approach
| Usability | Quick and easy navigation for not experienced users. | The main objective is to ensure that the user can intuitively navigate through the application, and understand how it works in a simple way.
| Security | The application needs to give confidence to be used without any risk. | We guarantee in the most efficient way that user data is protected by decentralised data storage .
| Privacy | We do not want a fraudulent use of the user's personal information | Only the information of the user and/or friends will be shown if the user requests it, otherwise private information will never be shown.
