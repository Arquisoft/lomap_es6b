|Explanation

|*User*
|Users interact with system by adding new places and being able to see the list of places that they have added.

|*Solid PODS*
|Solid PODS have information about userâ€™s addresses. We must store the shared information in a personal Pod according to the SOLID principles. The data is stored in a decentralized way.

|*Database*
|The database is used to store only the places' ID and coordinates just for the purpose of optimizing the app's performance.

|*OpenStreetMap API*
|The OpenStreetMap API is used to show a map with the places that the user has added. It is also used to let the user select in a map the place he wants to add. Lastly, it is also used for the autocomplete feature.
