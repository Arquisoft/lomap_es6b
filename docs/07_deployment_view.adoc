=== Infrastructure Level 1

Motivation::

For development and testing the execution environment we are working on each student’s machine. But when we´ll reach the production phase, we must deploy it in a Dockerized environment.

Quality and/or Performance Features::

We have chosen MongoDb to maximize the performance with Node.js.
In the production phase, the user experience should be maximized with a good internet connection, but this is something we cannot control.
