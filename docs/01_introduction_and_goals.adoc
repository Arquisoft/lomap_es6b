== Introduction and Goals

=== Requirements Overview
The application runs online. It also makes use of Solid Pods to not keep the information centralized, in order to preserve user's privacy. In this way, it decentralizes most of the userâ€™s data. Users will be shown a map where they can add locations, review scores, comments, etc. to create their own personalized maps. Each user will also be able to fully manage the information they provide to the application.

The full list of requirements of the application can be found in https://arquisoft.github.io/course2223/labAssignmentDescription.html[the assignment page].

=== Quality Goals

The requirements to be met are the following:

* *Availability* :
The system must have the capacity so the access to the data is totally reliable and consistent for users in order to make their operations with the system.

* *Decentralization* :
 All the information used by the system must be provided by the users, or had given the system the permissions in order to obtain that information.

* *Testability* :
The system must be testable in order to make a robust, secure and bug free system.

* *Secure* :
The system will carry out checks on potentially dangerous decisions for the user, such as to provide personal data to the system to make more personal the interaction with the system. We will also ensure that the requests and responses between client and the API are not compromised.

* *Accessibility/Usability* :
The system must be easy to use for beginners or people without previous technical knowledge. Likewise, the system should provide the necessary help to the user to be able to navigate through the program without any doubt, in addition to having to be accessible to all people. In order to do that, we decided to follow a minimalist rounded style.
